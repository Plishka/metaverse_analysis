# Earth2: ESS Token On-Chain Analysis

## Project Overview

**[Earth 2](https://earth2.io/)** is a 1:1 scale virtual representation of the Earth, where users can hold, trade, and own digital assets. As the largest Virtual Land Registry globally, Earth2 employs the utility token Essence (ESS) as its digital currency. This project aims to uncover investment opportunities and provide data-driven insights by analyzing the on-chain activity of ESS.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the on-chain activity of ESS to identify investment opportunities
2. Derive insights to support data-driven decision-making
3. Develop a comprehensive dashboard to visualize findings and enable future tracking of on-chain activities

## Data Processing and Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough analysis to understand patterns in ESS transactions and user behavior.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards using DuneAnalytics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: Managed and queried large datasets efficiently getting data directly from the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Dune Analytics**: Created interactive dashboards for intuitive data exploration.
